# Home-Assignment
This is my Assignment as part of my course Programming for Psychologists at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

# Project Description

In this project, I have taken data on Attention- collected from a meta-analysis of 1831 studies- which I downloaded from **Neurosynth**. I have mapped the functional data onto an anatomical model for better understanding and visualisation. The aim of the project is to create code that can visualise the given data and also be reproducible in nature. 
The link for the neurosynth data set is - https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/attention/
